analysis stack behaviour:

simplest working version:
replace analysis request with "everything".
update all analyses in order of declaration and save.

next simplest:
replace analysis request with "everything".
attempt to load all analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed or where any level of dependency had a failed load

next simplest:
replace analysis request with "everything".
attempt to load all analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question

next simplest:
acknowledge analysis request.
analyse dependencies at all levels of requested analysis and ignore others.
attempt to load analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question

next simplest:
acknowledge more than one analysis request per execution.
analyse dependencies at all levels of requested analysis and ignore others.
attempt to load analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question
