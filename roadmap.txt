analysis stack behaviour:

simplest working version:
replace analysis request with "everything".
update all analyses in order of declaration and save.

next simplest:
replace analysis request with "everything".
attempt to load all analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed or where any level of dependency had a failed load

next simplest:
replace analysis request with "everything".
attempt to load all analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question

next simplest:
acknowledge analysis request.
analyse dependencies at all levels of requested analysis and ignore others.
attempt to load analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question

next simplest:
acknowledge more than one analysis request per execution.
analyse dependencies at all levels of requested analysis and ignore others.
attempt to load analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question

===============================

analyses:

extend AxesAnalysis to calculate long axis and side axis
AxisVisualisationAnalysis (unimportant)
AngleDistributionAnalysis
JointDistributionAnalysis: base class
ParentJointDistributionAnalysis
HeightJointDistributionAnalysis
TerminalDistanceJointDistributionAnalysis
MonteCarloAnalysis: base class
AngleMonteCarloAnalysis
ParentMonteCarloAnalysis
TerminalDistanceMonteCarloAnalysis
HeightDependenceGroupAnalysis
LikelihoodRatioAnalysis (replace)

======================================

other:

tag analysis update methods with dates
tag analysis update methods with dates automagically?
generate filenames and paths in a sensible way: specify directory in json, make all other paths relative to that
date comparison
date generation
date verification
