analysis stack behaviour:

simplest working version (done):
replace analysis request with "everything".
update all analyses in order of declaration and save.

next simplest (done):
replace analysis request with "everything".
attempt to load all analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed

next simplest:
replace analysis request with "everything".
attempt to load all analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed or where any level of dependency had a failed load

next simplest:
replace analysis request with "everything".
attempt to load all analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question

next simplest:
acknowledge analysis request.
analyse dependencies at all levels of requested analysis and ignore others.
attempt to load analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question

next simplest:
acknowledge more than one analysis request per execution.
analyse dependencies at all levels of requested analysis and ignore others.
attempt to load analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question

===============================

analyses:

extend AxesAnalysis to calculate long axis and side axis
AxisVisualisationAnalysis (unimportant)
ParentDistributionAnalysis
DistanceDistributionAnalysis
HeightDependenceGroupAnalysis
LikelihoodRatioAnalysis (replace)

======================================

other:

Interface with python to generate visualisations
comments
generate filenames and paths in a nicer way
debug: test equality of serialised and deserialised json
timestamp logs
add remaining cells to stack
tag analysis update methods with dates
fixing stubgen autocomments that were later falsified
tag analysis update methods with dates automagically?
date comparison
date generation
date verification
unit tests
