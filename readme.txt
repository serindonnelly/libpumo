libpumo is a Library for Purkinje cell Morphology.

Libpumo provides facilities to define a stack of analyses, from raw data to results and significance tests.
Specifically, libpumo focusses on loading digitally reconstructed trees from SWC files and analysing their morphology to test hypotheses about the development of planar morphlogy in a variety of genotypes and ages.
List facilities allow changes to the dataset to be handled with a minimum of extra work.
