analysis stack behaviour:

simplest working version (done):
replace analysis request with "everything".
update all analyses in order of declaration and save.

next simplest:
replace analysis request with "everything".
attempt to load all analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed or where any level of dependency had a failed load

next simplest:
replace analysis request with "everything".
attempt to load all analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question

next simplest:
acknowledge analysis request.
analyse dependencies at all levels of requested analysis and ignore others.
attempt to load analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question

next simplest:
acknowledge more than one analysis request per execution.
analyse dependencies at all levels of requested analysis and ignore others.
attempt to load analyses in order of declaration and fail gracefully whenever a problem occurs
update all analyses where loading failed, or where any level of dependency had a failed load or was out of date, or where any dependency is more recent than the analysis in question

===============================

analyses:

extend AxesAnalysis to calculate long axis and side axis
AxisVisualisationAnalysis (unimportant)
ParentDistributionAnalysis
HeightDistributionAnalysis
DistanceDistributionAnalysis
HeightDependenceGroupAnalysis
LikelihoodRatioAnalysis (replace)

======================================

analysis enhancements:
serialise and deserialise functions for all non-tree analyses
generic json-based load and save functions in Analysis

======================================

other:

generate filenames and paths in a nicer way
log analyses registered, loaded, saved, updated
timestamp logs
tag analysis update methods with dates
tag analysis update methods with dates automagically?
date comparison
date generation
date verification
unit tests
